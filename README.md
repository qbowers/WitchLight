# WitchLight

Project 3 of MIT class CMS.611

WitchLight is an atmospheric horror platformer. You play as a witch that has unleashed an ancient evil. Navigate the manor, tracking down clues and ingredients for your potions, while trying to avoid the horrors you have created. Keep up your sanity, lest you succumb to fear. If you are brave, you may yet fix this.
